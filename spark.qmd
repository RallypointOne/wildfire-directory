# Research Directory: Spark - Wildfire Simulation Toolkit

## Overview
Spark is a semi-empirical operational fire spread model developed by CSIRO, specifically designed for operational fire management. This model focuses on utilizing GPU acceleration for high-performance computing, enabling ensemble simulations for improved forecasting accuracy. Spark is particularly tailored to the Australian landscape, incorporating detailed fuel models and environmental conditions to enhance fire behavior predictions. Its primary purpose is to provide fire managers and practitioners with a powerful tool for operational forecasting, aiding in decision-making processes during wildfire events. Spark plays a crucial role in wildfire management by offering advanced simulation capabilities that help in assessing fire behavior, spread patterns, and potential impacts on the landscape.
