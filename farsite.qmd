# FARSITE - Fire Area Simulator Research Directory

## Overview
FARSITE, the Fire Area Simulator, is a semi-empirical operational fire spread model developed by the USDA Forest Service. This spatially explicit fire growth simulation system is designed to assist in predicting the behavior of wildfires under various conditions. Its primary purpose is to provide fire managers and researchers with a tool for understanding and simulating the spread of wildfires, incorporating factors such as fuel models, weather conditions, and suppression tactics. FARSITE plays a crucial role in wildfire management by aiding in decision-making processes related to fire behavior prediction and resource allocation.
