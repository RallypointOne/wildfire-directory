# Research Directory: WFDSS - Wildland Fire Decision Support System

## Overview
The Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) is an integrated decision support tool developed collaboratively by the USDA Forest Service and the Department of the Interior (DOI). This system is designed to assist fire managers, researchers, and practitioners in making informed decisions related to wildfire management. WFDSS focuses on providing support for strategic planning, risk assessment, and multi-objective optimization to enhance decision-making processes during wildfire incidents.

WFDSS plays a crucial role in wildfire management by integrating complex data and models to facilitate real-time decision-making. By incorporating the latest scientific knowledge and technology, WFDSS enables users to assess fire risk, plan strategic responses, and optimize resource allocation efficiently. Its ability to consider multiple objectives and uncertainties makes it a valuable tool for addressing the dynamic and challenging nature of wildfires.
