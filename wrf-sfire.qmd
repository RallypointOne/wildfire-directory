# Research Directory: WRF-SFIRE - Coupled Atmosphere-Fire Model

## Overview
The WRF-SFIRE model, developed by NCAR/University of Denver, is a coupled atmosphere-fire model designed to simulate the complex interactions between wildfires and the surrounding atmosphere. This model enables two-way fire-atmosphere coupling, allowing for a more realistic representation of fire behavior under varying weather conditions. Its primary purpose is to enhance operational forecasting capabilities for wildfires, improve smoke transport predictions, and support decision-making in wildfire management. By integrating mesoscale weather data with fire behavior simulations, WRF-SFIRE provides valuable insights into fire dynamics and the impact of fires on the atmosphere.
