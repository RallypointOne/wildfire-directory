# HYSPLIT - Atmospheric Transport Model Research Directory

## Overview
The HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model is an atmospheric transport and dispersion model developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Primarily designed for smoke and air quality applications, this model plays a crucial role in wildfire management by providing valuable insights into smoke dispersion, trajectory analysis, air quality monitoring, and atmospheric transport patterns. By simulating the movement of particles in the atmosphere, HYSPLIT helps researchers and practitioners understand how wildfires impact air quality and how smoke plumes disperse over time and space.
