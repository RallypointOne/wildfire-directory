# AUSTRALIS - Australian Fire Spread Simulator Research Directory

## Overview
The AUSTRALIS (Australian Fire Spread Simulator) is a semi-empirical operational fire spread model developed by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) specifically for simulating fire behavior in Australian ecosystems. This model is designed to assist in the management of grassland fires, prescribed burning, and operational planning in the context of wildfire management. AUSTRALIS plays a crucial role in providing fire managers and practitioners with a tool to predict and understand fire spread dynamics in diverse Australian landscapes, ultimately aiding in decision-making processes during wildfire events.

## Key Features and Capabilities
- AUSTRALIS incorporates semi-empirical algorithms tailored to Australian fire behavior patterns.
- It accounts for various factors influencing fire spread, such as fuel types, weather conditions, and topography.
