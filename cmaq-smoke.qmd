# Research Directory: CMAQ - Community Multiscale Air Quality Model for Wildfire Researchers and Practitioners

## Overview
The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is a state-of-the-art chemical transport model designed to simulate air quality on regional to continental scales. Specifically tailored for studying smoke and air quality, CMAQ plays a crucial role in understanding the impacts of wildfires on regional air quality, smoke chemistry, photochemical processes, and regulatory applications. By providing insights into the atmospheric transport and transformation of pollutants, CMAQ aids in assessing the health and environmental implications of wildfire smoke, thereby guiding effective wildfire management strategies.
