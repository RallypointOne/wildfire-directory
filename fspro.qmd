# Research Directory: FSPro - Fire Spread Probability

## Overview
FSPro (Fire Spread Probability) is a probabilistic operational fire spread model developed by the USDA Forest Service. It is designed to provide probabilistic fire spread modeling, risk assessment, and decision support for large wildfires. FSPro utilizes advanced algorithms to estimate the likelihood and potential spread of wildfires under varying environmental conditions, aiding fire managers in making informed decisions for effective wildfire management strategies.

The primary purpose of FSPro is to enhance the situational awareness of fire managers by providing them with probabilistic forecasts of fire behavior. By incorporating uncertainties in weather conditions and fuel types, FSPro helps in assessing the potential fire spread risks, prioritizing resource allocation, and developing strategic containment plans. This model plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wildfire management operations, ultimately reducing the impact of wildfires on ecosystems and communities.
