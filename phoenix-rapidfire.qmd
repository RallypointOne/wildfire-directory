# Research Directory: Phoenix RapidFire Wildfire Model

## Overview
Phoenix RapidFire is a semi-empirical operational fire spread model developed by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (CRC). This model is specifically designed to simulate fire behavior in Australian conditions, particularly in eucalyptus forests, and focuses on key aspects such as ember transport and operational forecasting. Its primary purpose is to provide fire managers and practitioners with a tool to forecast and manage wildfire events effectively, thereby enhancing decision-making processes during fire incidents. Phoenix RapidFire plays a crucial role in wildfire management by offering a detailed understanding of fire spread dynamics and assisting in developing strategies to mitigate fire impacts.
