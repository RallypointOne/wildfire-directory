## Overview

Fire behavior models are essential tools for understanding and predicting wildfire spread. This page catalogs the major modeling approaches and software tools used in wildfire research and operations.

## Categories of Models

### Physical Models
Models based on fundamental physics of combustion and heat transfer:

- **FIRETEC** - Los Alamos physics-based model
- **WFDS (Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Dynamics Simulator)** - NIST model
- **FireFOAM** - OpenFOAM-based solver

### Semi-Empirical Models
Models combining physical principles with empirical observations:

- **FARSITE** - Fire Area Simulator
- **FlamMap** - Fire behavior mapping and analysis
- **BehavePlus** - Fire behavior prediction system
- **Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System**

### Statistical/ML Models
Data-driven approaches using machine learning:

- **Random Forest fire spread prediction**
- **Neural network-based models**
- **Ensemble prediction systems**

## Operational Systems

### WRF-Fire
Coupled weather-wildland fire model combining WRF atmospheric model with fire spread model.

**Key Features:**
- Two-way coupling between fire and atmosphere
- High-resolution fire behavior
- Smoke transport and dispersion

**Applications:**
- Operational forecasting
- Research studies
- Climate impact assessment

### FARSITE
Fire Area Simulator for wildland fire growth simulation.

**Key Features:**
- Spatial and temporal fire behavior
- Integration with GIS data
- Multiple fuel models

**Use Cases:**
- Prescribed fire planning
- Wildfire suppression tactics
- Risk assessment

## Data Requirements

Most models require:
- Digital elevation models (DEM)
- Fuel type maps
- Fuel moisture content
- Weather data (wind, temperature, humidity)
- Ignition sources

## Model Selection Guide

| Model | Best For | Complexity | Computational Cost |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| BehavePlus | Point predictions | Low | Minutes |
| FARSITE | Fire perimeter evolution | Medium | Hours |
| WRF-Fire | Weather-coupled simulations | High | Days |
| FIRETEC | Research studies | Very High | Weeks |
